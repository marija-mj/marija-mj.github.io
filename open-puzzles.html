          <h5>The challenge</h5>

          <h3>Budget and time as our biggest enemies</h3>

          <p>This was one of the freelance projects I did with another developer and a product owner. There were only three of us and the challenge was that all three of us lived in different cities and even different countries. This made communication very hard.</p>

          <p> We had a limited documentation based on research done by product owner who already knew the company that would buy the end product and didn't care much about spending time on proper user research. It was hard for me to completely understand the product and all of its features, but the time and budget for exploration were very limited.</p>
          <h4>My Role</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>researching the competition</li>

            <li>interviewing internal stakeholders</li>

            <li>sketching wireframes and application architecture</li>

            <li>creating responsive HTML and CSS pages</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="outer row justify-content-md-center">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h5>The approach</h5>

          <h3>Researching the competition</h3>

          <p>My hands were pretty tied and resources limited. I did a research of the competition, but the problem was that all similar products were not free and had no demos or trials so it wasn't easy to find out anything about the features they have and how people use them. </p>
          <p>
          Since there was no time for proper user research and there was no budget for that, I had to limit myself to interviewing only a few people that product owner knew would use the product, to gather some understanding of what they expected and see if we can align on the final vision for the product. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="outer colored row justify-content-md-center">
          <div class="col-md-6">
           <h3>Application architecture</h3>
           <p>
           We spent a lot of time trying to understand and come up with application architecture that would cover all possible user journeys that we were aware of. We were constantly going back and forth and due to a lot of misunderstandings from the stakeholders involved we made a lot of mistakes. </p>
           <p>Coming to an understanding and a shared vision was very hard as nobody was sure how the end product should work and the vision and requirements constantly changed based on new ideas as a result of team members constantly challenging each other.

           <h4>Wireframes as an essential part</h4>
           <p>
             Creating wireframes was very helpful to move forward as seeing something visually brought a lot of new questions and dilemmas. There was only enough time for high fidelity prototypes of the few main pages. When we reached an agreement on the basics of design style and language, I came up with a color palette and visual guidelines and went straight to coding. I used bootstrap framework to speed up the process and be able to quickly hand work over to the back end developer.

          <h5>Final results</h5>
          <h3>Where are the clients?</h3>
          <p>
            The product was successfully launched before the deadline and was presented in a conference before the potential clients and investors. However, apart from the already known client it was hard to find other ones that would be interested enough to even try the product. 
          </p>
          
          <h4>Key Learnings and Takeaways</h4>

          <p>
          The most interesting learning I got out of this project was that it was actually possible to create a product relying only on internal stakeholders and their expertise. I had to make key decisions and lead the project in the desired direction without getting sidetracked by minor details that were constantly surfacing. </p>
          <p> Although this was an interesting experience, I promised to myself I would never get involved in a project like this again. A project thatâ€™s done without involving the end users, without clear understanding who the target audience is or what's the actual problem we were trying to solve, is not something a UX designer could be proud of.
