            <h5>The challenge</h5>

            <h3>Finding the right audience</h3>

            <p>I was given a story (based on "who is doing what and why" approach) and had five days to come up with wireframes and hand over the documentation of the research I've done with all the UX deliverables. Being so limited with the time the challenge was finding the right users who would be willing to participate in the interview sessions and then validate the ideas and wireframes that I came up with.</p>
			<p>I also spent some time researching the competition to see what are users expectations and how they use similar apps. This was very insightful, but a lot of these apps were very complex and I wanted to keep this simple and contentrate on the main user goal: finding a replacement for a day or swap shifts with somebody else. 
			</p>
            <h4>My Role</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>interviewing stakeholders</li>

              <li>creating story board and empathy maps</li>

              <li>defining use journey and highlighting the top pain points</li>

              <li>sketching wireframes</li>

              <li>testing, observing and iterating based on feedback</li>

            </ul>
          </div>

            <h5>The approach</h5>

            <h3>Empathize to understand the user better</h3>

            <p>For research purposes, since my time was limited, I decided to talk to eight friends who all had different jobs but could potentially find this app useful. I set up contextual interviews with each one of them to collect the data around what they do, how they solve these problems now, what are their top pain points, and how would they invision the ideal solution. I contentrated only on the qualitative data I managed to collect.</p>
            <h4>Empathy Map</h4>
            <p>		
             Based on the information I gathered, I decided to create empathy maps to add an extra layer of meaning and empathy for users. I was able to better understand what each user says and does, thinks and feels while trying to accomplish their tasks. I was also able to highlight on one hand their pains and on the other their goals and needs.

         <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>Identifying where the problem occurs</h4>
          <p>Just as an exercise, I decided to create a storyboard, to better illustrate the problem and then made a simple journey with the steps each user takes and highlighted each step that contained a pain point and worked on addressing those. </p>

          <h3>Ideating</h3>
          <p>I worked on coming up with different solutions and brainstormed ideas around solving these problems. I tried using Crazy Eights - from design sprint kit, to boost my creativity. It turned out, even though all users I talked to had different professions, their needs were very similar.</p>
		  <p>They all wanted to have the possibility to send their requests to multiple people based on their job position and location. Most of them found the option to trade shifts very useful. And of cource, they wanted to be able to set their own availability and see their and other relevant requests in their personilized calendars. </p>

		<div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>Second round of feedback</h4>
        <p>
          I tested these ideas to gather feedback around what went well, what could be improved and wrote down new questions and ideas that surfaced during this process. After second iteration of the wireframes I was almost running out of time, so I decided to finalize my research and validate the ideas with some quick street testing.

        <h5>Final results</h5>

        <h3>Being specific matters</h3>
		Even though though there was not enough time to do any quantitave user research, so I could not back up my findings with any numbers, I had all delivarables ready for the due date. A lot of questions remained open as there were some specific use cases depending on the job position for which a replacement was needed. Because of these differences I realized I should have concentrated on a specific job type rather than trying to cover many different ones.
        <h4>Key Learnings and Takeaways</h4>

        <p>

          This was an interesting project because even though the deadline was tight, I was able to do everything the right way, going through all the steps of the design thinking process and completely concentrating on the user and design for them. This was a rare opportunity because in real life scenarios, due to lack of time and budget, some steps usually have to be omitted.
