          <h2>CPQ is a business application that allows you to quickly configure, price, quote, propose, and sell your offerings. We already had an outdated product but we needed to make it work on any device. </h2>

            <h5>The challenge</h5>

            <h3>Responsive or native?</h3>

            <p>The whole CPQ team consisting of the director, a product manager, developers and me, a UX designer, got together to discuss how do we make our product work on any device. We considered three possibilities: Native, Hybrid or Responsive. There were many pros and cons for each so making a decision was not easy. </p>
            <p>The biggest issue with going Native was, of course, lack of resources as we didn't have any developers that could tackle this in the time needed. Hiring hew people was not always as easy, and the deadline for new product release was already announced and it was looming over us. We decided to make it responsive as the first step and then see if it makes sense investing in building native applications.

              <h4>My Role</h4>

              <ul>
                <li>analyzing and defining problems with the current UI</li>

                <li>creating sketches and wireframes</li>

                <li>internal usability testing</li>

                <li>creating responsive pages in HTML and CSS with a bit of KnockoutJS</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="outer row justify-content-md-center">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h5>The approach</h5>

              <h3>Making it responsive is not enough</h3>

              <p>The main goal of rewriting the whole product was to make it work faster and work on any device. No other improvements were planned, but since the product was ten years old and features were constantly added to it and our users struggled a lot using outdated user interface, we wanted to make sure user experience was also improved. </p>
              <p>This meant more time would be needed and more resources would need to be involved which was not something management was happy about. I worked as an only UX designer on this project and had to constantly navigate between product managers and developers.</p>
              <h4>Usability</h4>
              <p>Since we got the green light to improve the product from functional point of view as well rather than just "pretty it up" and make it responsive, it was hard to decide what to concentrate on. There were so many things that needed improvement and we had a lot of documentation we gathered from usability testing and user research we did before. Most of our user pain points were already well known to us, it was only a matter of combining everything into an actionable document. </p>
              <p>Since this project was just as big from the development perspective, I worked closely with development teams from the beginning which allowed us to work in parallel, so we were able to produce things faster.</p>
            </div>

          </div>
          <div class="outer colored row justify-content-md-center">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h3>Pick something but do it right</h3>
              <p> I managed to combine top pain points from various different sources and rewrote them into "who is doing what and why" point of views. These contained the most common tasks our users had to do on a daily basis. Still there were too many action points and our time was limited.</p>
              <p>	We decided to plot each big cluster of POVs into an impact grid and concentrate only on those parts that had high impact and were easy to do from development perspective. Easy for us this time meant something that could be finished by the time release was planned. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 image-holder">
              <div class="img-small"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/impact-grid.jpg" /></div></div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Test and move on</h4>
                <p>Concentrating only on certain things also gave me more time to do some quick and dirty internal testing of the improvements we were planning to make. Since we didn't have enough time we skipped the prototyping phase and from tested wireframes went straight to coding. Since by this time we already had a <a href="design-system.html">design system</a> in place, this was not a big problem. </p>

                <h5>Final results</h5>

                <h3>Successful launch</h3>

                <p>After successful launch, even though not a lot was changed from the functional or even usability point of view, the new look made our clients happy and excited to try out the new product. We gave them an option to try the new product but also go back to the old one for any missing functionalities. </p>
                <p>We had a busy next few releases testing the changes with our clients and rewriting the rest of the product making sure everyone had enough time to adjust. </p>
                <h4>Key Learnings and Takeaways</h4>

                <p>
                  Even though picking the responsive approach might not have been ideal for such complex product, It was impressive to see how fast certain changes can be made with limited resources dedicated to one task.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I learned how to cope with tight deadlines, to coordinate within a big team, to organize all the different tasks and to be a link between project manager and developers. This was a very interesting project for me as I was fully involved with the front end development as well.
