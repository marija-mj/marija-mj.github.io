            <h5>The challenge</h5>

            <h3>Creating a product from scratch</h3>

            <p>The biggest challenge for me was to create a product from scratch without
              being fully aware of who our end users are and without any clear
              documentation. When the two of us designers met with the product managers, it
              turned out they already had a vision of how the product should work, based on
              their own hunch, by combining features of a few successful products that were
            on the market already (something I had to fight over and over again).</p>

            <p>Of course, managers just wanted a working product and they wanted it fast,
            so our small, two people design team had to:</p>

            <p>&#8212; Prove that by investing more in user research and spending more
              time on generating ideas before actually doing any development would pay
            off.</p>

            <p>&#8212; Find out more about competition and understand our potential
              audience, to figure out what set of features we should offer in order to
            stand out from the competition.</p>
            <h4>My Role</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>moderating stakeholder interviews</li>

              <li>creating user personas and user journeys</li>

              <li>facilitating ideation sessions</li>

              <li>sketching wireframes and creating high fidelity prototypes</li>

              <li>doing usability testing</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="outer row justify-content-md-center">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h5>The approach</h5>

            <h3>Who are our users?</h3>

            <p>First, as usual, we begged for more time and got two weeks to prove that
              what we learn is going to be more beneficial than what the managers already
            "knew". So we rolled our sleeves and got to work.</p>

            <p>In order to create something useful, we had to get familiar with our
              target audience, who they are and how they do these tasks today. We managed
              to get a list of our potential clients and we decided to do a bunch of
              stakeholder interviews to understand them better in order to create something
              that they would want to use. The recruitment process was not perfect as we
              didn't have a lot of users to choose from, but we've made sure to interview
              five users from each of the three groups managers had already defined. All
            three groups were doing different tasks depending on their job positions.</p>
            <h4>Observing and learning</h4>

            <p>We gathered information about what kind of duties they have, what tools
              they use, and how they do their everyday tasks today. Whenever they talked
              about their day to day work, a lot of pain points came up that we could not
              possibly be aware of. As a bonus question, we gave everyone a magic wand and
            asked in an ideal world, how would they perform these tasks.</p>
            <p>There is nothing as inspiring as real users
              getting excited talking about their vision of the tools that they use on a
            daily basis.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Creating personas</h4>

            <p>We wanted to create personas to help us better understand
              users' needs, expectations, behaviors and goals and to
            make it easier to identify ourselves with our users.</p>

            <p>Since we didn't have any more time, we
              couldn't back up our qualitative findings with any
              quantitative research, so we decided to rely only on information we got from
              speaking to users. Based on all these learnings we could already spot
              similarities in goals and behaviors among each of the three groups of
            users.</p>

              <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Creating a user journey</h4>

                <p>We mapped a couple of different user journeys that each of our three
                  personas would be taking. We defined each step in the journey along with
                  actions that they are currently taking to complete each task. We also mapped
                  their feelings and thoughts to better understand their pain points and see
                which areas needed improvements.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-12 image-holder">
                <div class="img-small"><img class="img-fluid" src=
                  "img/user-journey.jpg" /></div></div>
                </div>

                <div class="outer colored row justify-content-md-center">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>Ideation</h3>

                    <p>We defined each need as one Point of View and challenged ourselves
                      with How Might We questions to open up the brainstorm and ideation
                      session with all stakeholders. This helped us tackle all problems in a number
                      of different ways so we came up with a lot of different solutions and voted
                    for the best ones.</p>

                    <p>With all this information it was easy to create some basic wireframes so
                      that we could talk with our end users again to understand if our solutions
                      would solve their problems and to make some final adjustments based on their
                    feedback.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="img-large"><img class="img-fluid" src=
                    "img/ideation-full.jpg" /></div>
                  </div>

                  <div class="outer row justify-content-md-center">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                      <h5>The presentation</h5>

                      <h3>What did this give us?</h3>

                      <p>We presented our findings and it turned out the users were not exactly
                        doing what the managers thought they were, so we managed to convince them
                        that by being user centered we could actually create something people would
                      want to use and that would make us stand out from the competition.</p>

                      <p>In the end, we got an MVP that solved most of the
                        users' needs for the product launch and we already had a
                      full backlog of new ideas for future releases.</p>
                      <h4>Key Learnings and Takeaways</h4>

                      <p>This was a very interesting project for me because it was the first big
                        project that I had to develop from scratch with only one more designer.
                        Because of the tight deadlines, I learned how to work under pressure. By
                        regularly presenting all the learnings and progress to the stakeholders I
                      also improved my communication skills.</p>
