          <h1>Design System</h1>

          <p><span>Client: CallidusCloud, year 2017</span></p>

          <h2>We wanted to build a design system in order to maintain consistency across different products and different teams. But in the end, we actually wanted to help our users.</h2>

            <h5>The challenge</h5>

            <h3>What was consistency, again?</h3>

            <p>Our biggest problem was how to come up with the design system that will work across different types of products that serve completely different needs and even work under different platforms. We realized this problem was worth addressing when we saw how different teams were struggling to implement different UI solutions for the same problem, and our users were struggling to learn how to use all these different products. The consistency in user interface and user experience was something we could only dream about.</p>

            <p>The two of us designers got together with the product manager and asked ourselves two questions:</p>

            <p>&#8212; How to make something that is flexible enough but will still allow us to unify certain things.</p>

            <p>&#8212; How to involve every stakeholder and get everyone on the same page as to what we want to achieve, why this is important, and how each stakeholder can contribute.</p>
            <h4>My Role</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>doing a heuristic review of the products </li>

              <li>conducting stakeholder interviews</li>

              <li>mapping different UI elements into atomic design system</li>

              <li>writing HTML/CSS code for each element</li>

              <li>usability testing of new UI solutions</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="outer row justify-content-md-center">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h5>The approach</h5>

            <h3>Documenting and more documenting</h3>

            <p>We knew very well what we needed to do. First, together with marketing teams, we created a visual design language that consisted of colors, typography, sizing, spacing and icons. This wasn’t really hard since the company already had some basic guidelines in place so we only needed to agree on how we see the new visual language and what needs to be improved. We documented everything in a better way and made it a company’s standard so every stakeholder could be aware of the change.</p>

          <div class="row col-md-12"></div>
          <div class="img-small">
           <img class="img-fluid margin-right" src="img/symbols-colors.jpg" />
           <img class="img-fluid" src="img/sketch-library.jpg" />
         </div>
         <div class="row col-md-12"></div>
         <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>Atomic Design</h4>
          <p> The hardest part though, was identifying all the different UI patterns used across all products, starting from simple buttons to the very complex user interface components and pages. We needed a clear methodology for crafting our design system, so for mapping the UI elements, we decided to use the atomic design approach. The biggest advantage of this approach for our complex systems was the ability to easily mix and match components and make code more consistent by using modules.</p>
          <p>We documented each pattern and mapped it as atom, molecule, organism, template or page. For the sake of making developers’ life easier, we also described each pattern and provided documentation on when and how it should be used.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="outer colored row justify-content-md-center">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>Improving usability</h3>

            <p> Apart from making things consistent, we saw this as a perfect opportunity to work on improving the user experience as well. So we conducted a heuristic evaluation of each product, having in mind ten usability heuristics for user interface design by Jakob Nielsen. We documented each UI pattern that had a usability problem that needed to be addressed.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h5>The presentation</h5>

            <h3>Final results</h3>

            <p>In order to prove the effort was worth it, we needed to come up with a business proposal that would validate all the time and effort we were planning to put into this. Doing a full heuristic review of one of our products with the actual proposals helped us show the real benefits of doing this project to all the stakeholders involved.</p>
            <h4>Key Learnings and Takeaways</h4>

            <p>
              This project helped me learn to appreciate the team work. It helped me understand how important it is to know your product and involve the end users in the whole process from the beginning. It was hard to predict every little detail and understand how different people might understand things differently so I learned a lot from my own mistakes on how to tackle a complex project like this.
